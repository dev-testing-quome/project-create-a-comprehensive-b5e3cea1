## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL recommended for production):**
   -  Follow the instructions in the `backend/database` directory to set up your database.  This typically involves creating a database and user.  Update the database connection string in the backend configuration accordingly.

5. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   # Backend (from backend directory)
   uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

   # Frontend (from frontend directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build and start both the frontend and backend containers.


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the API documentation at:

* **OpenAPI (Swagger UI):** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**(Example - Replace with actual endpoints and data)**

**Key Endpoints:**

* `/users`:  Manage user accounts (POST for registration, GET for retrieval, etc.)
* `/trades`: Execute trades (POST to place an order).
* `/portfolio`: Retrieve portfolio information (GET).
* `/marketdata`:  Get real-time market data (GET, likely requires authentication and potentially WebSocket connection).


**Sample Request (POST /trades):**

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "quantity": 100,
  "orderType": "MARKET",
  "side": "BUY"
}
```

**Sample Response (Successful Trade):**

```json
{
  "orderId": "12345",
  "status": "FILLED",
  //... other details
}
```

**Common Workflows:**  Detailed workflows should be documented in separate files or wiki pages.
