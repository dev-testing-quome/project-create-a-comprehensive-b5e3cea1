# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers contributing to the "project-create-a-comprehensive" SEC-compliant trading platform.

## Prerequisites

**Required Software Versions:**

* **Python:** 3.9 or later (for backend)
* **Node.js:** 16 or later (for frontend)
* **PostgreSQL:** 14 or later (or compatible database)
* **Docker:** 20.10.0 or later (recommended for Option 1)
* **Docker Compose:** 1.29 or later (recommended for Option 1)

**Development Tools:**

* Git
* Text editor or IDE (see recommendations below)

**IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**

* **VS Code:** Highly recommended for both frontend and backend development. Install extensions for Python, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL support.  Configure linters (e.g., Pylint for Python, ESLint for JavaScript) and formatters (e.g., Black for Python, Prettier for JavaScript).
* **PyCharm (Professional Edition):** Excellent for Python backend development, offering robust debugging and testing tools.
* **WebStorm:** A powerful IDE for frontend JavaScript development.

## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

This option simplifies setup by encapsulating all dependencies within Docker containers.

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.

3. **Development Docker-Compose Configuration:** The project should include a `docker-compose.yml` file defining the services (backend, frontend, database).  A sample might look like this:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@db:5432/mydb
         # ... other environment variables
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
         - POSTGRES_DB=mydb
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  Use tools like `nodemon` (for frontend) and a Python debugger (like pdb or a debugger integrated into your IDE) for backend hot reloading.  For frontend, you might need to configure your build process (e.g., Webpack) to enable hot reloading.


### Option 2: Native Development

This option requires installing dependencies directly on your system.

1. **Backend Setup (Python):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup (Node.js):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:**  Download and install PostgreSQL. Create a database named `mydb` (or as specified in your configuration) with a user `postgres` and password `password` (change these for security).


## Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables:**

* `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the database.
* `SECRET_KEY`:  A secret key for session management (backend).
* `API_KEY`:  For external API integrations (e.g., market data).
* `DEBUG`:  Set to `true` for development, `false` for production.
* ... other environment variables specific to the application (e.g., payment gateway credentials).

**Local Development .env File Setup:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or as specified) and populate it with your local environment variables.  **Never commit `.env` to version control.**

**Configuration for Different Environments:** Use a configuration management system (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) to manage settings for development, testing, and production environments.

## Running the Application

1. **Start Commands:**
   * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
   * **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver`) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

2. **Access Frontend and Backend:** Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration) and the backend API through the specified endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1`).

3. **API Documentation:** The project should include API documentation (e.g., using Swagger or OpenAPI).


## Development Workflow

**Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:** Use Gitflow or a similar branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, pull requests).

**Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Configure linters (e.g., Pylint, ESLint) and formatters (e.g., Black, Prettier) to ensure consistent code style.

**Testing Procedures:**  Implement unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.

**Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugging tools or command-line debuggers (e.g., `pdb` for Python).


## Database Management

**Running Migrations:** Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.

**Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate the database with sample data for development and testing.

**Database Reset Procedures:**  Include scripts to easily reset the database to a clean state.


## Testing

**Running Unit Tests:**  Use a testing framework (e.g., pytest for Python, Jest for JavaScript) to run unit tests.

**Running Integration Tests:** Test interactions between different components of the system.

**Test Coverage Reports:** Generate reports to track test coverage.


## Common Development Tasks

**Adding New API Endpoints:** Follow the established API design and coding style.

**Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use a component-based architecture (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).

**Database Schema Changes:** Use database migrations to manage changes.

**Adding Dependencies:**  Use a package manager (e.g., pip, npm) to add dependencies and update `requirements.txt` or `package.json`.


## Troubleshooting

**Common Setup Issues:** Check for errors in the logs, ensure all dependencies are installed correctly, and verify environment variables.

**Port Conflicts Resolution:** Change ports in your configuration if there are conflicts.

**Dependency Issues:**  Use a virtual environment (for Python) and carefully manage dependencies.

**Environment Variable Problems:**  Double-check your `.env` file and ensure variables are correctly set.


## Contributing

**Code Style Guidelines:** Adhere to the project's coding style guide (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).

**Pull Request Process:**  Create pull requests for code contributions, and ensure they are reviewed before merging.

**Issue Reporting:**  Report issues using the project's issue tracker.  Provide detailed descriptions and steps to reproduce the issue.


This guide provides a foundational setup.  Specific commands and configurations will depend on the project's structure and technologies used.  Consult the project's README and documentation for more detailed instructions. Remember to prioritize security best practices throughout the development process, especially when handling sensitive financial data.
